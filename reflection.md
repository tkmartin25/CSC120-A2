What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I thought the video on Moodle was helpful, and I thought going to TA hours was helpful. What I shouldn't have done is waited until Monday to start the assignment. It was also helpful to work on it with someone else in the class. Finally, the one card example was also really helpful for me to begin understanding how classes work.
